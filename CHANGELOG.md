## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `ghidra disasm-at ADDRESS [--count N]` — disassemble at an address,
  disassembling first if no instruction is there yet, and report whether an
  instruction actually landed there (`ok`/`landed`), since `disassemble()` can
  report success with nothing landing at the target.
- `ghidra function create ADDRESS [NAME]` now auto-disassembles at the target
  first if no instruction exists there, instead of failing outright.
- `ghidra clear START:END [--to-data] [--disasm-at ADDR]` — clear code units
  overlapping a range (undoes auto-analysis that mis-disassembled through
  inline data), optionally re-disassembling at a precise address in the same
  call.
- `ghidra function set-noreturn TARGET [--value true|false]` — mark a function
  as never returning to its call site. `no_return` and `tags` are now included
  in `function get`/`function list` output.
- `ghidra function tag add/remove/list TARGET TAG_NAME` and
  `ghidra function list --tag TAG_NAME` — native function tagging
  (Ghidra's `FunctionTagManager`/`Function.addTag`), replacing the
  `[subsys:name]` PLATE-comment convention some projects used as a workaround.
- `ghidra script run -` reads Java source from stdin for one-off scripts
  (staged to a temp file and compiled through the same path as a file on
  disk), so a throwaway snippet no longer needs a checked-in file.
  `ghidra doctor` now documents why `script python`/`script java` (inline
  eval) stay disabled.
- `ghidra type apply ADDRESS TYPE --force` (alias `--clear-conflicting`)
  clears a conflicting data unit first instead of failing on it.
- `ghidra comment set ADDRESS --stdin` / `--text-file PATH` read comment text
  outside the shell argument, avoiding silent corruption from shell
  metacharacter expansion (e.g. backticks) in free-form prose.
- Structured error detail for three previously-opaque failures — `function
  create` on an address already owned by another function (owner
  name/entry/size), `function create` when `createFunction` returns `null` or
  throws (diagnoses no-instruction vs. inside-existing-function vs.
  mid-code-unit causes), and `type apply` "Conflicting data exists" (the
  conflicting unit's kind/type/range). Printed as JSON with `-vv`/`--json`.
- `ghidra program save` — flushes pending changes (rename/comment/patch/
  type/symbol/tag ops, etc.) to disk so the Ghidra GUI or a fresh bridge can
  see them. The bridge cannot save in place while running (Ghidra's headless
  script-execution harness holds a transaction open for its whole lifetime),
  so this stops and immediately restarts the bridge against the same
  program. `ghidra stop` also persists (without restarting); `program close`
  no longer attempts an in-place save it can't perform — a response `note`
  now says so explicitly instead of silently discarding the intent.

- **Responsive control plane with a real job queue.** Socket handling is now split
  from Ghidra program execution. `ping`, `status`, `bridge_info`, `jobs`, and
  `cancel` answer immediately from thread-safe snapshots while a long
  `analyze`/`import`/decompile holds the single Ghidra-owned program lane. Program
  operations get job IDs and wait in a bounded FIFO (256 deep) instead of an
  invisible socket backlog.
- `ghidra jobs [JOB_ID]` — inspect the active job, the queue, and recent history
  (the bridge keeps the last 100 jobs), or one job by ID.
- `ghidra cancel [JOB_ID]` — cooperatively cancel the active job (or a specific
  one). A job that hasn't started is dropped from the queue immediately; a running
  job is cancelled via a per-job `TaskMonitor`.

### Changed

- `ghidra script run` runs a checked-in script by absolute path with real
  positional arguments (everything after `--`) and captured stdout, returning
  `{script, path, stdout, args}`. New `--expect PATH[:MIN_ROWS]` (repeatable) fails
  the job when an output artifact is missing, empty, or short; `--allow-empty`
  permits an expected-but-empty file. Scripts run on the cancellable job lane, so
  `ghidra cancel` works on them.

### Fixed

- Commands issued while the bridge is busy now wait in the queue instead of
  failing with "bridge not responding" — a slow analysis no longer looks like a
  dead bridge.
- Import now treats stale empty `.gpr`/`.rep` project artifacts as uninitialized
  and uses the durable one-shot import path instead of trying to start a
  project-mode bridge that Ghidra rejects because it contains no programs.
- Removed the inert legacy config key `timeout`. Old YAML files containing it
  still load, but the key is dropped when saved and `config set timeout` points
  to the active read, long-operation, connection, and launch timeout controls.
- `patch nop --count N` now NOPs N consecutive instructions (was: silently
  ignored, only the instruction at the address was patched). The client forwards
  the count and the bridge walks instruction by instruction, so variable-length
  ISAs work; if any address in the run has no instruction the whole patch rolls
  back.
- `comment set --comment-type PRE|POST|PLATE` now takes effect (was: always
  `EOL`). The client sent the type under key `type` while the bridge read
  `comment_type`; the client now sends `comment_type` and the bridge still
  accepts the old key as a fallback.
- `ghidra script run` no longer fails intermittently with "Failed to get OSGi
  bundle containing script" for `.java` scripts. Two bugs compounded: the
  bridge resolved the target script through `GhidraScriptUtil`'s ambiguous
  "first registered ancestor directory" bundle lookup instead of the exact
  bundle it had just registered, so an unrelated, broader script directory
  registered earlier (e.g. from another project) could shadow it; and a
  reflective `Class.forName()` call with a literal class-name string caused
  the bnd OSGi analyzer to add an unwireable `Import-Package` to the bridge's
  own bundle, breaking bridge startup outright. `script run` now builds and
  loads the class from the exact bundle it resolved for the script's
  directory.
- `symbol rename`/`symbol delete NAME` no longer silently mutate every symbol
  in the program sharing `NAME` (Ghidra reuses auto-generated names like
  `caseD_XX`/`LAB_XXXX` across unrelated addresses). Both now require
  `--address`/`--filter` to disambiguate a name shared by more than one
  symbol, or `--all` to explicitly opt into affecting every match; `symbol
  delete --filter` now actually scopes the deletion instead of being silently
  ignored.
- `type create` now rejects a value that isn't a bare identifier (e.g.
  `type create "struct Foo {}"`) instead of silently creating a type
  literally named after the whole unparsed string. It only ever creates an
  empty struct — build fields afterward with `type add-field`.
- `--filter "address = '0xADDR'"` (quoted, `0x`-prefixed) now matches the
  same symbol as `--filter "address = 'ADDR'"`. Address-shaped filter fields
  (`address`, `entry_point`, `from`, `to`, `min_address`, `max_address`)
  tolerate an optional `0x`/`0X` prefix on the compared value.
- `function rename OLD NEW --address ADDR` no longer silently ignores
  `--address`. It now scopes the rename to the function whose entry point is
  exactly `ADDR`, and errors loudly (instead of renaming an unrelated
  function) if `OLD` doesn't match the function actually found there. Same
  root cause as the `symbol rename` fix above: Ghidra reuses auto-generated
  names across unrelated addresses, so a bare name isn't a safe rename target
  without `--address`.
- `memory read ADDR SIZE` no longer fails on overlay-qualified addresses
  (e.g. `rom20::69f0`) with `Failed to read memory: For input string ...
  under radix 16`. The address argument now goes through the same
  `resolveAddress` helper `disasm-at`/`function get`/etc. already use instead
  of a bare hex parse restricted to the default address space.
- `clear RANGE` no longer fails to parse overlay-qualified ranges (e.g.
  `rom1::5512:551d` or `rom1::5512:rom1::551d`) with `Invalid start address:
  rom1`. `RANGE` was split on the first `:`, which took everything before the
  `::` bank separator as the whole start address; it now splits on the `:`
  that actually separates start from end, treating `::` as a unit, and a bare
  end address inherits the start address's overlay space.
- A `script run` job that outlives `GHIDRA_CLI_READ_TIMEOUT` no longer prints
  an error indistinguishable from a real failure. The client giving up on the
  read is now a distinct `Timeout:`-prefixed message with exit code 75
  (`EX_TEMPFAIL`), separate from the generic `Error:`/exit 1 used when the
  bridge actually reports failure — the job itself is unaffected and keeps
  running server-side (poll it via `ghidra jobs <id>`).

## [0.2.1]

### Fixed

- **`--limit 0` now means "all rows"** (was: returned 0 rows). Both the
  client-side paginator and the bridge request treat `--limit 0` as unlimited,
  matching the bridge's own convention, and it no longer falls back to the
  1000-row default. This makes complete exports
  (`ghidra dump exports --limit 0`, `function list --limit 0`, …) work as
  documented instead of silently writing `[]`.
- **Malformed `--filter` expressions now fail with a clear error** (was:
  the parse error was swallowed and the CLI dumped the *entire unfiltered,
  unlimited* dataset while exiting 0). A bare word like `--filter PK` is
  rejected up front — before any bridge fetch — with a hint to use
  `name~PK` (contains) or `name=~"^PK_"` (regex). The filter DSL is now
  summarized in `--help` for `--filter` and `--limit`.
- **`=~` regex filters are now case-insensitive**, matching the other string
  operators. Field values are lowercased before matching, so an uppercase
  pattern like `name=~"^PK_"` previously matched nothing, silently.
- Filter regexes are compiled once per pattern instead of once per row,
  removing a large constant cost when filtering datasets with millions of
  rows (e.g. 1.9M symbols).

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- **Automatic full-JDK detection for Ghidra.** Ghidra compiles its bridge script
  at runtime and needs the `jdk.compiler` module, so a JRE (or a `jlink`-trimmed
  image) silently fails. ghidra-cli now resolves a suitable JDK itself —
  requiring `javac`, the `jdk.compiler` module, and major version ≥ Ghidra's
  minimum (21 for Ghidra 12.x) — and hands it to `analyzeHeadless` via
  `JAVA_HOME` rather than relying on Ghidra's PATH-based pick. Override with the
  `--java-home <PATH>` global flag, `java_home` config, or `GHIDRA_CLI_JAVA_HOME`.
- Global `--project` / `--program` flags — usable before any subcommand
  (e.g. `ghidra --project P --program bin function list`); previously these were
  accepted only per-subcommand.
- Global `--projects-dir <DIR>` flag (with `ghidra_project_dir` config and
  `GHIDRA_PROJECT_DIR` env) to choose where Ghidra projects are stored.
- `ghidra import --no-analyze` — import a binary without running auto-analysis
  (the program is still persisted).
- `ghidra program export` now supports the built-in Ghidra exporters in addition
  to JSON: `xml`, `c`/`cpp`, `binary`/`bin`, `gzf`, `ascii`/`asm`, `hex`, and
  `html`. Exporters are resolved by class name and 4-arg arity so they keep
  working across Ghidra versions.
- Config `launch_timeout_secs` (env `GHIDRA_CLI_LAUNCH_TIMEOUT`, default 180s) —
  bounded cap for bridge launch readiness. Env `GHIDRA_CLI_OP_TIMEOUT` caps the
  otherwise-unbounded long-running TCP ops (`analyze` / `import`).

### Changed

- `ghidra import` now runs auto-analysis by default (over TCP) and reports the
  resulting `function_count`. Use `--no-analyze` to skip it.
- `ghidra doctor` and `ghidra setup` now require and verify a **full JDK** (not
  just any Java on `PATH`): `doctor` reports the selected JDK and compiles the
  embedded bridge script as a real health check, surfacing the actual error on
  failure.
- The `ilspy-cli` companion tool was extracted into its own repository and is no
  longer part of this workspace.

### Fixed

- **`ghidra import` no longer hangs on non-trivial binaries.** The bridge now
  launches via `-preScript -noanalysis` (was `-postScript` with full analysis),
  so its TCP socket binds right after the binary loads — before analysis — and
  readiness is fast. Analysis runs afterwards as an unbounded TCP `analyze`
  operation (which also persists the program via `analyzeAll` + `save`),
  decoupling a **bounded launch** (JVM start + OSGi compile + load, capped by
  `launch_timeout_secs`) from **unbounded analysis**.
- Bridge launch/teardown can no longer hang or orphan a JVM. The JVM tree is
  spawned in its own process group and a launch failure/timeout kills the whole
  group (`killpg` on unix, `taskkill /T` on windows) **before** joining the
  output reader threads. Previously the readiness wait capped at 120s while
  analysis kept running, then killed only the `analyzeHeadless` wrapper (not the
  JVM grandchild) and blocked forever joining pipes the surviving JVM held open.
- `ghidra stop` now force-kills the whole bridge process group as a fallback,
  not just the JVM PID.
- `ghidra program close`, `program delete`, and `program export` now work — the
  Rust client was sending command names (`close_program`, `delete_program`,
  `export_program`) the Java bridge never registered, so they always errored.
- `--filter`, `--sort`, `--count`, and `--offset` are now honored on all list
  commands (`function list`, `strings list`, `symbol list`, `type list`,
  `query`, `dump`). The bridge only does a literal substring match on the name
  field, so ghidra-cli now fetches the full dataset and applies the real filter
  DSL, sort, pagination, and count client-side.
- Call-graph and callee traversal now find every call within a function body,
  not just calls at its entry point (the reference scan now iterates all
  reference sources in the function body).
- `program export --format binary` and the other native exporters no longer fail
  on Ghidra 12: the `Exporter.export` method is resolved by name + 4-arg arity
  rather than an exact `Program.class` signature that drifted across versions.
- Default project directory no longer breaks on Linux with Ghidra 12.1+, which
  rejects any project location containing a dot-prefixed path component
  (e.g. `~/.cache`). The default now falls back to `~/ghidra-cli-projects` when
  the cache path has a hidden component (macOS/Windows keep their cache-dir
  location).
- `ghidra project delete` now actually deletes the project. It removes the
  Ghidra `<name>.gpr` / `<name>.rep` artifacts (previously it looked for a
  non-existent `<name>` directory and silently deleted nothing) and stops any
  running bridge first so the project lock is released. `ghidra project info`
  likewise reports `Exists` based on those artifacts.
